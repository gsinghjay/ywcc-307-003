## Project Description

The Department of Homeland Security has committed to 12 cloud service offerings, including nine private cloud offerings and three public cloud offerings, as part of its commitment to the White House's "Cloud First" policy. By moving its disparate dev and test systems into a private cloud, DHS anticipates being able to greatly accelerate the delivery of new software and services. Server provisioning time should decrease from six weeks to a day, and the service will include on-demand testing and app management. Your team is asked to submit a tech proposal to the department of homeland security for this cloud implementation project. Your submission should specifically respond to the context referred in this prompt.
